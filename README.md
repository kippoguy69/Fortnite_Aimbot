# Fortnite_Aimbot
Simple Fortnite aimbot hack.




How do I add a hitmarker sound?
Create a hitsounds folder inside the base Fortnite directory. Place as many .wav sound files as you want inside of it. Load the cheat and they will be under the hitsounds combobox.

Where are config files stored?
Profiles are stored inside the base Fortnite directory under a folder named profiles.

You can share profiles with friends by navigating to the configuration tab inside the cheat and selecting Export. This will copy all profile data to the clipboard which you can then paste to a friend.

To import a profile, just copy all of the profile data and press Import. Make sure to save your profile by entering a name and pressing Save.

Why does moving the menu crash the game?
Disable multi-core rendering in your Fortnite video settings.

How do I open the menu?
Press INSERT.

How do I unload the cheat?
Press END.
